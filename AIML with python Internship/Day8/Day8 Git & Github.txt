(1)version control system 
-source code management system 
-keep record  of version of the projects.

(2) need of version control system 
-to remove overlaping 
-to store the each and every update and metadata

(3) benefits of version control system
-backup the files 
-time sving

    # Features of Git 
•	Distributed version –no network required ,  no single point of failure 
•	Staging area – virtual area between working space and local repository  , hashing conversion  , lesser mb file 
•	Open source , free 
•	efficient

    # Architecture of Git 

    -Working directory = Staging => local repository => Remote Repository

•	git add . commend used from working directory to staging
•	git commit -m ‘message’ is used from staging area to local repository
•	git push /git clone is used from local repository to remote repository

    # flow of the file in Git 
•	Untracted / modified  it is in working space 
•	Staged  after the git add . command then file is saved in staging area then this state is called staged
•	Repository  after the git commit file it is In local git repository 

    # Git Commands 

•	ls => it will show all the files in the working space / working folder .
•	mkdir folder-name =>  used to make the folder 
•	touch file.txt => used to make the file 
•	ls -files => it will show the only files which included in staging area
•	git status => it will show the current position of the file 
•	git add . => used to add the file from the staging area
•	cat file.txt => helps to show the content of the file
•	git restore –staged file.txt => remove the file from the staging area
•	git log => to show the history of the project and  it’s commits
•	rm rf file.txt => help to delete the file 
•	git reset “hash value of the post commit “ => it will remove the pre commits of this hashing value of post commit
•	git stash => it will help to save the file into the back stage .
•	git stash pop => it will help to again recover the file in the staging area
•	git stash clear => remove the file from the staging area and file are gone
•	create the remote repository in the github
•	git remote add origin “URL of the Repo which we have created in the github” => help to link up the local repo to remote repo
•	git remote -v => shoe  all the file attach in the URL
•	git push origin master => update the changes from local repo to remote repo 
•	git branch new => if we want new feature and removing bug the we create branch
•	git  checkout new => it will help to point the head pointer into new branch
•	git merge new => it will help to merge the file into the part of main branch
•	fork => working with exiting another   project like open source then we use fork
•	clone => it will create the copy of the another exiting project in our working directory
