# Saksham-24_Falcons_Internship
This Repsitory is contain all my Work and Projects of artificial Intelligence and machine Learning with python  Internship with Training at Falcon's Beyondtheimagination company.
This is 45 days  Internship with Training.

In This Internship 
Phase 1. Python Programming: Get comfortable with Python syntax, data structures (lists, dictionaries), control flow (if/else, loops), functions, and basic libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

#=================================={ PYTHON }============================================#

Python Operators:   Arithmetic operators
                    Assignment operators
                    Comparison operators
                    Logical operators
                    Identity operators
                    Membership operators
                    Bitwise operators

Python's basic data types : Numeric
                            Sequence Type
                            Boolean
                            Set
                            Dictionary
                            Binary Types( memoryview, bytearray, bytes)


Control statements in Python:  Python uses "If", "Elif", "Else" statements, loops like "For" and "While", and control statements like "Break", "Continue", and "Pass".

Python Libraries for AI & ML:   SciPy(scientific computations)
                               NumPy (numerical computing)
                               Pandas (data manipulation and analysis)
                               Matplotlib/Seaborn (data visualization)

#=================================={ Git / Github }============================================#
  Phase 1: Git Basics 

Installation: Download and install Git on your computer following the official instructions https://www.git-scm.com/downloads.
Configuration: Set up your username and email for Git commits using git config --global user.name "Your Name" and git config --global user.email "your@email.com".
Core Commands: Learn the fundamental Git commands like git init (initialize a repository), git add (add files to staging area), git commit (commit changes with a message), git status (check the status of your repository), and git log (view commit history).
Version Control: Grasp the concept of version control and how Git tracks changes in your code over time.
Local Repository: Understand the concept of a local repository where your project's history is stored.

Phase 2: GitHub Fundamentals 

Create an Account: Sign up for a free GitHub account.
Remote Repositories: Learn about remote repositories hosted on GitHub and how they connect to your local repository.
Pushing and Pulling: Understand how to git push your local commits to a remote repository on GitHub and git pull changes from GitHub to your local repository.
Branches: Get familiar with Git branching, which allows you to create isolated environments for development and collaboration. Learn how to create branches (git branch), switch branches (git checkout), and merge branches (git merge).
Collaboration: Explore how to collaborate with others on GitHub using branches, pull requests, and code review.


Phase 3: Intermediate Git 

Staging Area: Deepen your understanding of the staging area and how it helps you manage changes before committing.
Ignoring Files: Learn how to use the .gitignore file to exclude specific files or folders from version control.
Undoing Changes: Explore commands like git reset and git revert to undo mistakes or revert to previous versions.
Resolving Conflicts: Learn how to handle merge conflicts that arise when different versions of the same file are merged.
Stashing Changes: Understand the concept of stashing, which allows you to temporarily save uncommitted changes and come back to them later.


Phase 4: Advanced Git and GitHub 

Branching Strategies: Explore different branching strategies like Gitflow or feature branching to manage complex projects effectively.
Rebasing: Learn about rebasing, an advanced technique for rewriting your commit history.
Submodules: Understand how to use Git submodules to include external projects within your repository.
GitHub Features: Dive deeper into advanced GitHub features like protected branches, issue tracking, project management tools, and organization management (if applicable).
Git Hooks: Explore Git hooks to automate tasks before, during, or after specific Git events.

Learning Resources:

Throughout my  journey, refer to the official Git documentation https://www.git-scm.com/ and GitHub guides https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world.
Many interactive tutorials and websites offer hands-on practice with Git commands https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials.
