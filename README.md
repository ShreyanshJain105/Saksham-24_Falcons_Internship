# Saksham-24_Falcons_Internship
This Repsitory is contain all my Work and Projects of artificial Intelligence and machine Learning with python  Internship with Training at Falcon's Beyondtheimagination company.
This is 45 days  Internship with Training.

In This Internship 
Phase 1. Python Programming: Get comfortable with Python syntax, data structures (lists, dictionaries), control flow (if/else, loops), functions, and basic libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

#=================================={ PYTHON }============================================#

Python Operators:   Arithmetic operators
                    Assignment operators
                    Comparison operators
                    Logical operators
                    Identity operators
                    Membership operators
                    Bitwise operators

Python's basic data types : Numeric
                            Sequence Type
                            Boolean
                            Set
                            Dictionary
                            Binary Types( memoryview, bytearray, bytes)


Control statements in Python:  Python uses "If", "Elif", "Else" statements, loops like "For" and "While", and control statements like "Break", "Continue", and "Pass".

Python Libraries for AI & ML:   SciPy(scientific computations)
                               NumPy (numerical computing)
                               Pandas (data manipulation and analysis)
                               Matplotlib/Seaborn (data visualization)
